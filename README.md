# port-scanner

A simple Python-based port scanner that helps identify open ports on a target system for cybersecurity testing and network reconnaissance.

Scans a range of ports (default: 50-85)
Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
Displays scanning start time
Detects open ports
Handles errors gracefully

How It Works

The script takes a target IP/domain as an argument.

It scans ports 50 to 85 using a TCP connect scan.

Open ports are displayed in the output.

Errors (e.g., hostname resolution failure) are handled.
